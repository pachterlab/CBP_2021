# CBP_2021

Notebooks for reproducing all figures and analysis in the *The Specious Art of Single-Cell Genomics* [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.457696v1).

## Getting Started

Where possible, analysis notebooks (.ipynb) are provided that can be run from Google Colab. Colab links are included in every notebook. Just click on the [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com) symbol.

An intro to using Colab can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com). Briefly, run each code cell by selecting the cell and executing Command/Ctrl+Enter. Code cells can be edited by simply clicking on the cell to start typing.

All saved/processed data used for analysis is streamed to the notebooks from [CaltechData](https://data.caltech.edu/).
